As language technology is complex, it is crucial to keep the incidental complexity of the tool used as low as possible.
MPS might not be the best tool in this regard, but it can be used in a way that lets students grasp the essential concepts.
This works out if the teaching setup is aligned with the features of MPS and introduces functionality step by step.
This approach is aided very well with the stability and adequate documentation of MPS such that students get all the information they need.
With this approach, students can understand the underlying concepts, and thereby they master the tool MPS.
Still, there are some serious shortcomings of MPS with regard to teaching.
Fixing them might even help the general applicability of MPS.
The work on appropriate meta-languages is a significant part of this improvement process.
