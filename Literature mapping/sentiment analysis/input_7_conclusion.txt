In this paper we described our work towards an open-source framework for blended graphical–textual UML modelling based on Eclipse, Papyrus and Xtext.
The framework aims at advancing the state of the practice of blended UML modelling by providing support for: textual grammar customisability, flexible application of multiple stereotypes on UML base elements using textual languages, cross-profile modelling based on blended notations, on-the-fly changes propagation across notations, and cross-notation multi-view modelling.
We ran two experiments to assess the potential impact of blended solutions on modelling effort, in terms of time.
Different notations are more suitable for different modelling tasks and, besides previous experience of the modeller with one or the other, enforcing the use of a task-optimal notation can decrease modelling time.
Overall, stakeholder’s free choice of notation does decrease modelling time and subjects used to a specific notation perform overall better using their preferred notation.
Nevertheless, for specific modelling tasks, enforcing a task-optimal notation has a better impact on modelling time.
To summarise, we can conclude that a balanced combination of freely chosen and fixed task-dependent notations may represent the optimal solution.
The goodness of such a combination depends on two factors: modelling tasks to be performed and stakeholder’s preferences.
For this reason, it is hard to identify a generic optimal combination.
In any case, we could observe that blended capabilities bring improvements in the modelling activities and decreases modelling time.
