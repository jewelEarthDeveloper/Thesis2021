Language Wheel is apparently the first workbench that focuses on purely example-driven definition of languages.
We find it particularly important to guide a language engineer by using language flavors, which can be thought of as (meta)schemata for language definition process.
The current state of implementation of Language Wheel is in the very early phase.
Many of the details of how various concerns of language definition can be defined using annotations remain to be elaborated.
Foremost, this applies to typing rules and scopes of visibility.
Identifying commonly used concepts (together with their associated annotation perspectives) that will constitute the standard library of Language Wheel is an interesting task in itself.
Many of those annotation perspectives will require some notion of a generic definition to be instantiated when specifying a particular language; for example, quickfixes can be considered as generic transformations
