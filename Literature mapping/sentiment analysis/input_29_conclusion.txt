In this paper, we propose a DSL for IoT domain, called OntIoT, which is based on the SSN ontology.
The approach, used to build OntIoT, is generic that could be applied to build a DSL from any ontology.
OntIoT is based on projectional editing technique.
Our ongoing research is to evaluate the proposed DSL in a real scenario.
We plan to complete the mapping rules between OWL and DSL to cover the missing OWL constructs.
Furthermore, we plan to utilize OWL reasoning algorithms to enrich the OntIoT editor with more semantic features.
In addition, a graphical editor will be implemented for the proposed DSL.
