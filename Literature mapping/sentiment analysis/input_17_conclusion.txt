In this paper, we presented an approach which allows for modeling structure as well as behavior of a software system using an integrated tool combining two OMG standards: UML and ALF.
While UML package diagrams and class diagrams are used for modeling the structure, method bodies – i.e., the behavior of a method – are specified using ALF.
Fully executable Java source code may be generated from the resulting model system which can be integrated seamlessly in existing software ecosystems.
The integrated user interface abstracts from the underlying set of models and provides a unified look and feel for the end user allowing for graphical as well as textual modeling.
The feasibility of the approach has been demonstrated using an example workflow which may occur in real-life iterative software development processes.
