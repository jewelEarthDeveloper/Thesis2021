In this paper we presented our framework for generic projectional editors for arbitrary EMF models.
In contrast to syntax-based editors which are derived from the grammar of a modeling language and which persist the representation, e.g., text, instead of model files, our approach allows for persisting models including the preservation of inter-model references.
The main benefit of persisting models instead of their representations, e.g., plain text, is a much easier integration in the existing EMF modeling ecosystem as existing tools and technologies for processing the obtained models can be used out of the box.
In its current state, the framework allows developing customized textual editors for textual languages with minimal effort.
While the context-free syntax of the language is specified by means of an intuitive declarative language, static semantics can be customized by implementing high-level code stubs.
The feasibility of our approach has been demonstrated by a projectional editor for the textual modeling language ALF.
Future work comprises the integration of other model representations including diagrams and tables and support for user-specific validation, code highlighting, hovering, etc.
Concepts for language imports and compositions will be taken into consideration, as well.
Furthermore, we plan to remove dependencies to the Xtext and Xtend implementations.
