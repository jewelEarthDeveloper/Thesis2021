The design of our editor will not perform better for simple edits in terms of number of keystrokes, but only for complex editing operations.
However, rather than looking at the number of keystrokes, the total time spent performing edits may be a more representative figure, as it allows to include the overhead of switching to the mouse to perform selection and navigation.
We plan to experiment with different designs to make the editor approachable and learnable, such that we can carry out controlled experiments to make stronger statements on the editorâ€™s performance.
