Projectional editing Projectional editing is another research area which investigates the use of various concrete syntaxes for editing models by displaying the different concrete syntaxes as projections.
JetBrains MPS and MelanEE  apply this approach.
With projectional editing, the user edits the model through a syntax-specific view or editor, which itself updates the underlying abstract syntax model and these changes are automatically reflected in other views or editors for alternative concrete syntaxes.
The main advantage is that the model can be projected in various concrete syntaxes depending on what the user prefers.
However, it adds a considerable overhead for the DSML developer as the user actions (i.e., keyboard, trackpad and mouse events) have to be translated into change actions on the abstract syntax tree.
For parser-based textual DSMLs (e.g., when using Xtext), a text editor in combination with a lexer/parser combination can be used.
