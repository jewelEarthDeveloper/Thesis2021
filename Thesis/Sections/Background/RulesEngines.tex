\section{RulesEngines}

\subsection{What is a rules engine?}

In this section we will describe what a rules engine is and a little of its history.

The Aristotelian doctrine of essentialism declares that a thing has properties that are essential and properties that are accidental.
If one takes away accidental properties, then the thing remains the thing.
If one takes away essential properties, the thing is no longer the thing.
If the thing is a business application, then its essential properties are its business rules.


Simply put, business rules are the principles or regulations by which an organization carries out the tasks needed to achieve their goals.
When properly defined these rules can be encoded into statements that defines or constrains some aspect of the business organizational behaviour.
A rule consists of a condition and an action. 
When the condition is satisfied then the action is performed.
More formally, business rules can be seen as the implication in the basic logical principle of Modus Ponens.

When described like this, one could me forgiven for thinking is this not just an if\-then logic that is frequently used in traditional programming.
One would not be wrong, however in traditional programming, representing all the combinatorial outcomes can become complex.
In the typical application architecture, rules are distributed in the source code or database.
Each additional rule leads to more fragility.

Documentation describing these rules may be found in the design documentation or user manuals.
However, as applications evolve documentation gets out of sync with codebase.
Once this desynchronization occurs, to know what the rules that govern the application, one has to navigate the codebase and decode the rules from their, often scattered, locations.

A rules engine is also known as a Business Rules Engine, a Business Rules Management System or a Production Rules System.
The goal of a rules engine  is the abstraction of business rules into encoded and packaged logic that defines the tasks of an organization with the accompanying tools that evaluate and execute these rules.
Rules engines match rules against facts and infer conclusions. 
If we return to the Modus Ponens comparison:

\begin{tabular}{c@{\,}l@{}} 
    & $p$ \\
\arrayrulecolor{blue!60!green!70}    & $p \to q$ \\\cline{2-2}
$\therefore$         & $q$ \\
\end{tabular}

If the premise $p$ holds. And the implication $p \to q$ holds then the conclusion $q$ holds. 
In terms of a rule engine and business rules this could be seen as:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the rules engine gathers the data for the premise: $p$
    \item it examines the business rules as the implications: $p \to q$
    \item it executes the conclusion: $q$
\end{enumerate}


Rules Engines are declarative, focussing on the what of the rules not the the how of the execution.
Date\cite{date2000not} describes rules engine as to ``specify business process declaratively, via business rules and get the system to compile those rules in to the necessary procedural (and executable) code.''
Fowler\cite{Fowler_rulesEngine} describes rules engine as follows: `` ... providing an alternative computational model.
Instead of the usual imperative model, which consists of commands in sequence with conditionals and loops, a rules engine is based on a Production Rule System.
This is a set of production rules, each of which has a condition and an action ...''.

Rule engines arose from the expert systems of the late 70s and early 80s. 
Expert systems initially had three main techniques for knowledge representation: Rules, frames and logic\cite{jackson1986introduction}.  
"The granddaddy" of the expert systems, MYCIN, relied heavily on rules based knowledge representation\cite{shortliffe1974mycin}, rather than long inference chains.
MYCIN was used to identify bacteria and recommend antibiotic prescriptions.
MYCIN and its progenitor, DENDRAL, spawned a whole family of Clinical Decision Support Systems that pushed the rules engine technology until the early 1980's.
Research into rules engines died out in the 1980s as it fell out of fashion.

Early in their existence, the rules engines hit a limiting factor because the matching algorithms they used suffered from the utility problem, i.e. the match cost increased linearly with the number of rules being examined/
This problem was solved by Charles Forgy's efficient pattern matching Rete algorithm\cite{forgy1989rete}, and its successors.
This algorithm works by modelling the rules as a network of nodes where each node type works as a filter. 
A fact will be filtered through this network.
The pre-calculation of this network is what provides the performance characteristics.




In general, rules engines are forward chaining.  This means to test if

Moving forward to current times, there are a few rules engines currently in use.
Some of the more commonly used ones are shown in table \ref{table:RuleEngines}

Some of the advantages of using a rules engine include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The separation of knowledge from it's implementation logic
    \item Business logic can be externalized
    \item Rules can be human readable
\end{itemize}


In summary a rules engine, is the executor of a rules based program, consisting of discreet declarative rules which model a part of the business domain.
