This chapter gives the background information that should help a reader get situated in this area of research.
We begin by clarifying what a rules engine is and the specific case of the one that we will be using for our investigation: Drools.
Next, we delve into the world of projectional editing.
Finally, we present the specific projectional editing tool we will be using: JetBrains MPS.

\section{Summary}
Business rules languages codify business rules to be executed in an application.
Drools is one of the most popular DSLs for business rules.
Drools can become difficult to reason about when it contains many rules.

Projectional editing is the concept of updating and storing the AST directly.
All interactions to update the AST is done through editors that are projections of the AST.
These projections can take many forms.

MPS is a language workbench that specialises in creating projectional editors for DSLs.
