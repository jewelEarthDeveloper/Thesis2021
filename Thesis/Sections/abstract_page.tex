    \textit{Context}: 
    Declarative rules engine languages, such as Drools, can become difficult to reason about when there are many rules.

    \noindent
    \textit{Objective}: 
    This project investigates how different projections of the code can ease the comprehensibility of the code

    \noindent
    \textit{Method}: 
    We created an implementation of the Drools language using the MPS language workbench and made innovative projections of large ASTs
