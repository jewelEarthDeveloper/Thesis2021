\noindent
\textit{\textbf{Context}}: 
Declarative rules engine languages, such as Drools, can become difficult to reason about when there are many rules.

\noindent
\textit{\textbf{Objective}}: 
This project investigates whether projectional editing is a reasonable solution to this issue.
If so, how can different projections of the Abstract Syntax Tree ease the comprehensibility of the code?

\noindent
\textit{\textbf{Method}}: 
We conducted a systematic literature review to ascertain the relevancy of projectional editing.
We implemented the Drools language using the MPS language workbench and made innovative projections of Drools ASTs.
We validated our projections with a survey. 

\noindent
\textit{\textbf{Results}}:
Projectional editing is still niche, though it makes some industrial and educational headway, particularly with JetBrains MPS. 
Projections can be helpful. 
However, our survey found that our projections did not outperform the understanding of textual representation, at least amongst experience Drools users.
