\chapter*{Abstract}

Rules engine languages are languages used to gather together and execute the rules of an application.
Declarative rules languages, such as Drools, can become difficult to reason about when there are many rules.
This project investigates whether projectional editing is a reasonable solution to this issue.
If so, how can different projections of the Abstract Syntax Tree ease the comprehensibility of the code?
We conducted a systematic literature review to ascertain the relevancy of projectional editing.
We implemented the Drools language using the MPS language workbench and made innovative projections of Drools ASTs.
We validated our projections with a survey. 
Projectional editing is still niche, though it makes some industrial and educational headway, particularly with JetBrains MPS. 
Projections can be helpful.  
Contributions of this project include an overview of the current state of projectional editing, an alternative base language for model-to-model transformations in MPS, and projections that provides a more compact manner to enter and view Drools rules.
