    \textit{Context}: 
    Declarative rules engine languages, such as Drools, can become difficult to reason about when there are many rules.

    \noindent
    \textit{Objective}: 
    This project investigates how different projections of the code can ease the comprehensibility of the code.

    \noindent
    \textit{Method}: 
    We created an implementation of the Drools language using the MPS language workbench and made innovative projections of large ASTs.

    \noindent
    \textit{Results}:

    \noindent
    \textit{Keywords}:
    projectional editing; Rules Engines; MPS; Drools

    \noindent
    \textit{Paper type}:
