We start in chapter \ref{chapter:Background} with the required background information on rules engines and projectional editing.
In chapter \ref{chapter:SLR} we describe our efforts to answer our first research question using a systematic literature review.
Chapter \ref{chapter:ADR} describes the approaches and outcomes of answering the second research question using active design research. 
Chapter \ref{chapter:Survey} brings us to research question 3 and the survey we used to explore it.
We then investigate related work in chapter \ref{chapter:RelatedWork}.
Finally, we present the conclusions of our research in chapter \ref{chapter:Conclusion}.
