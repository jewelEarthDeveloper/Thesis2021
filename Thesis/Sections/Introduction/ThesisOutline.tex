Chapter \ref{chapter:SLR} describes our efforts to answer our first research question using a systematic literature review. 
Chapter \ref{chapter:DSR} describes the approaches and outcomes of answering the second research question using design science research. 
Chapter \ref{chapter:Survey} brings us to research question 3 and the survey we used to explore it.
We then investigate related work in Chapter \ref{chapter:RelatedWork}.
Finally, we present the conclusions of our research in Chapter \ref{chapter:Conclusion}.
