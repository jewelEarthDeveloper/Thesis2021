\section{Research Questions}
\label{section:Research_Questions}

We can formulate the following research question based on the discussion in the preceding sections being:

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item \textbf{Main research question:} ``Is projectional editing a viable and effective solution to issues developers have with reasoning about Drools business rules?''
\end{itemize}

This question requires knowing if it is even possible or practical with currently available tooling. 
As researchers, we would also like to know if this is a compelling area to research. 
Thus, we would like to answer the question:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item \textbf{RQ 1:} ``What is the current state of language workbenches supporting projectional editing?''
\end{itemize}

Next, we specifically would like to know how to what we can create to improve the developer's ability to reason about the business rules engine, so we ask the question:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item \textbf{RQ 2:} ``Which projections can we create to help developers get appropriate feedback about rules?''
\end{itemize}

Finally, we would like to know how the current Drools developer community would respond to projectional editing, particularly the projections we create.
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item  \textbf{RQ 3:} ``Do projections of Drools business rules lead to a greater understanding of those rules?''
\end{itemize}
