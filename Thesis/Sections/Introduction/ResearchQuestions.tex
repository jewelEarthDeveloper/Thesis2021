\section{Research questions}\label{section:Research_Questions}

To reason about a large code base of rules engine code effectively, a different presentation is needed.  
This presentation should allow a clearer organization whilst remaining interactive.
We can formulate the following research questions based on the discussion in the preceding sections.

The research question we wish to answer is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Main research question:} ``How can projectional editors and DSLs be combined to address feedback mechanisms for developers in the context of reasoning about rules in a rule-based business engine?''
\end{itemize}

This question requires knowing if it is possible with current tooling, thus we would like to answer the question:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ 1:} ``What is the current state of language workbenches supporting projectional editing?''
\end{itemize}

Finally, we specifically would like to know how we can improve the ability to reason about the business rules engine, so we ask the question:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ 2:} ``Which projections can help developers to get appropriate feedback about rules?''
\end{itemize}
