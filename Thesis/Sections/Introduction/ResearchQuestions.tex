\section{Research Questions}
\label{section:Research_Questions}

We can formulate the following research question based on the discussion in the preceding sections being:

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item \textbf{Main research question:} ``Is projectional editing a viable and effective solution to issues developers have with reasoning about Drools business rules?''
\end{itemize}

This question requires knowing if it is even possible or practical with currently available tooling. 
As researchers, we would also like to know if this is an interesting area to research. 
Thus, we would like to answer the question:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item \textbf{RQ 1:} ``What is the current state of language workbenches supporting projectional editing?''
\end{itemize}

Next, we specifically would like to know how to what we can create to improve the developer's ability to reason about the business rules engine, so we ask the question:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item \textbf{RQ 2:} ``Which projections can we create to help developers get appropriate feedback about rules?''
\end{itemize}

Finally, we would like to know how the current Drools developer community would respond to projectional editing, and in particular the projections we create.
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item  \textbf{RQ 3:} ``Do projections of Drools business rules lead to greater understanding of those rules?''
\end{itemize}
