\section{Research Questions}
\label{section:Research_Questions}

We can formulate the following research questions based on the discussion in the preceding sections being:

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item \textbf{Main research question:} ``How can projectional editors and the Drools language be combined to address issues of reasoning about business rules?''
\end{itemize}

This question requires knowing if it is even possible or practical with currently available tooling. 
As researchers, we would also like to know if this is an interesting area to research. 
Thus, we would like to answer the question:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item \textbf{RQ 1:} ``What is the current state of language workbenches supporting projectional editing?''
\end{itemize}

Finally, we specifically would like to know how to improve the ability to reason about the business rules engine, so we ask the question:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item \textbf{RQ 2:} ``Which projections can help developers get appropriate feedback about rules?''
\end{itemize}
