\section{Problem Statement}

Drools is a language that shares an unfortunate characteristic with many other rules languages.
Namely, It is verbose and can contain many rules that can interact without an apparent visual connection.
As Forgy\cite{forgy1989rete} points out, for rules languages in general, ``[they] have another property that makes them particularly attractive for constructing large programs: they do not require the programmer to specify in minute detail exactly how the various parts of the program will interact''.
This property leads to very large and difficult to reason about collections of implicitly connected rules.

Reasoning over a small number of rules is already surprisingly hard.
Our host organization has many rules and, thus, reasoning about them is particularly challenging.

One approach to tackle comprehensibility could be to consider Miller's Law\cite{miller1956magical}.
This states that an average human can hold in his short-term memory 5-9 objects, which is often an argument for succinct code.
The argument is that the developer must store anything that is not immediately in her vision in her memory.
With it being impractical to reason about code that she cannot recall, the fewer relevant items to her reasoning that are out of view, the easier it is to reason about the code.

We have observed the difficulty developers have to try to reason about and edit collections of Drools files.
We hypothesize that when we present developers with different views on their code, they can better understand it.
The problem we wish to solve - how to improve the ability to reason about sizeable collections of Drools rules - we believe lends itself to the technique of projectional editing.
By using projections to improve feedback whilst coding, we believe that this can reduce the representation impedance mismatch that hampers the developer's reasoning.

Our intention is not to override the language engineers who have spent many years developing this language and its ecosystem.
In contrast, it is to augment the current developer experience.
Thus, the problem considered in this thesis is how to present large sets of rules to a developer to interact with them easily.
