\section{Problem statement}

Miller's Law\cite{miller1956magical} states that an average human can hold in his short-term memory 5-9 objects.
This is often an argument for more succinct code.  
The argument being anything that is not immediately in the developers vision has to be stored in her memory.
With it being impractical to reason about code that she cannot recall, then the fewer relevant items to her reasoning that are out of view the easier it is to reason about the code.
