This thesis proposes a representation of business rules in a concise and readable format that could solve comprehensibility issues resulting from large codebases of business rules.
The implementation behind the approach relies on language engineering and projectional editing.
We developed a stand-alone opensource solution on a limited implementation of Drools.
The underlying Drools implementation can be used as a base language for model-to-model generation by the MPS ecosystem.

In summary, the concrete contributions of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{\textbf{The Projectional Editing Status Quo}} in our SLR, we provide an overview of the current state of research in the field of Projectional Editing
    \item \emph{\textbf{An alternative Base Language}} with a bit of extra work, the Drools-Lite language can be used as an alternative base language for model-to-model transformations in MPS.
    \item \emph{\textbf{A new way to enter rules}} our implementation allows Drools developers a more compact manner to enter rules.
\end{itemize}
