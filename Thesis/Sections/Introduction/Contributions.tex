This thesis proposes a representation of business rules in a concise and readable format that could solve comprehensibility issues resulting from large code-bases of business rules.
The implementation behind the approach relies on language engineering and projectional editing.
We developed a stand-alone opensource solution on a limited implementation of Drools.
The underlying Drools implementation can be used as a base language for model-to-model generation by the MPS ecosystem.
