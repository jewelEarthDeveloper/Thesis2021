This thesis proposes a code representation of business rules in a concise and readable format that could solve comprehensibility issues resulting from large code bases of business rules.
The implementation behind the approach relies on language engineering and projectional editing.
An implementation has been developed as a stand alone opensource solution on a limited demonstration version of Drools.
The underlying Drools implementation can be used as a base language for model to model generation by the wider MPS ecosystem.
