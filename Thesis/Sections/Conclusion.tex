We have built our projections as an aid to the understanding of Drools rules.
This DSL extension includes many different ways to look at and interact with large code bases, as well as presenting options to deal with the complexity of individual rules.
This means that they must be [TODO: PROPERTIES THAT AIDS UNDERSTANDING].
Our questionnaires show that we have reached that aim.
Since developing our projections we have used them to model complex rules in our host organization.

Two factors lead to our success.
First was the flexibility and extensibility of the MPS tool which presented the ability to develop and extend DSLs very efficiently.
If we had tried this project without this tooling we would have [TODO: Finish our thoughts]
Second [TODO: Finish our thoughts]

In this paper we described our work with first translating the Drools DSL into a projectional language followed by our explorations of projections.
We discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the different projections we created and analysed experienced developers reactions to them.

Whilst we are convinced our projections [TODO: finish our thoughts]
