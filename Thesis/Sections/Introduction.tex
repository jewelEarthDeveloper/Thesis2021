In Chapter \ref{chapter:Method} we present the research questions.
Further, the chapter describes the protocol that we use for search strategy, selecting our studies, extracting data from them, and synthesizing the results.
Chapter \ref{chapter:Results} presents the results of our synthesis of data from the primary studies.
This is followed, in chapter \ref{chapter:Discussion}, by a discussion of both the validity of the work and the implications of the findings.
We discuss the implications of this study in chapter \ref{chapter:Implications}.
Finally, the conclusions are presented in chapter \ref{chapter:Conclusion}.
