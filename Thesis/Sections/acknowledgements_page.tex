It took a European village to raise this master's project.


We want to acknowledge The Graduate School of Informatics in the Faculty of Science at The University of Amsterdam for their guidance, specifically Dr Clemens Grelck, who has been a supportive, understanding, and available academic adviser.


We received inspiration from the Strumenta languages engineering community.
Specifically, we would like to thank Federico Tomasetti, who shared his model of a rules engine in MPS.


Also, we would like to thank Václav Pech from JetBrains for the course he created and the time he spent with us explaining MPS.
Further, Sergej Koščejev from JetBrains helped us with specific MPS issues.


Further, we thank Michel Mercera, who, among other things, provided us with helpful guidance on conducting and analysing surveys.


Our greatest thanks go out to Toine Khonraad, an alum of this course, who provided us with the support, wisdom and friendship that aided in completing this, our fourth attempt at getting this project behind us.
Without his constant mantra of ``simplify, simplify, simplify'', we would still be implementing the Drools languages without making a single projection.
