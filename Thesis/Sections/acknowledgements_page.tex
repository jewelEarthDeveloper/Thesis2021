    We would like to acknowledge the School of The Gradate school of Informatics in the Faculty of Science at The University of Amsterdam for their guidance, specifically Dr. Clemens Grelck, who has been a supportive, understanding, and available academic adviser.
    

    We received inspiration from the Strumenta Languages engineering community.
    Specifically we would like to thank Federico Tomasetti, who shared with me his model of a rules engine in MPS.


    Also we would like to thank Václav Pech from JetBrains for the course he created and the time he spent with me explaining MPS.
    Further, Sergej Koščejev from JetBrains helped us with specific MPS issues during his Office hours.


    Other prolific output that terrifically helped our research and development was the Heavy Meta YouTube series from Kolja Dummann and the dozens of papers and books from Markus Voelter, both currently working at Itemis A.G.

    
    Our greatest thanks go out to Toine Khonraad, an alum of this course, who provided me with moral and monetary support, as well as wisdom and friendship that aided in the completion of this, my fourth attempt at getting this project behind me.
    Without his constant mantra of simplify, simplify, simplify, we would still be implementing the Drools languages now without having made a single projection.
