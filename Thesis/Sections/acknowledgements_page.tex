    We would like to acknowledge the School of The Gradate school of Informatics in the Faculty of Science at The University of Amsterdam for their guidance, specifically Dr. Clemens Grelck, who has been a supportive, understanding, and available academic adviser.
    
    My greatest thanks go out to Toine Khonraad, an alum of this course, who provided me with moral and monetary support, as well as wisdom and friendship that aided in the completion of this, my fourth attempt at getting this project behind me.
