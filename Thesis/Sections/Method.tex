To answer the research questions from section \ref{section:Research_Questions}, we formed three approaches.
We answered the question ``What is the current state of language workbenches supporting projectional editing?'' by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR), which we describe in section \ref{section:Method_systematic_review}.
We followed two linked approaches for the question ``Which projections can help developers get appropriate feedback about rules?''.
Firstly, using Action Design Research (ADR), we implemented Drools as a projectional editor, and then some projections that users can edit.
We describe this approach in section \ref{section:Method_action_research}.
Then, as we detail in section \ref{section:Method_survey}, we presented our findings to experienced Drools users through a questionnaire survey to validate this approach.
