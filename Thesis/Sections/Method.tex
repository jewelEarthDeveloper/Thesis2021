To answer the research questions from section \ref{section:Research_Questions}, we formed three approaches.
To answer the question ``What is the current state of language workbenches supporting projectional editing?'', we carried out a Systematic Literature Review, which we describe in section \ref{section:Method_systematic_review}.
We followed two linked approaches for the question ``Which projections can help developers get appropriate feedback about rules?''.
Firstly, using Action Design Research (ADR), we implemented Drools as a projectional editor, and then some projections that users can edit.
Then, we presented our findings to experienced Drools users through a questionnaire survey to validate this approach.
