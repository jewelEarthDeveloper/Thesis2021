\label{chapter:Survey}

In this chapter, to answer the question ``Do projections of Drools business rules lead to a greater understanding of those rules?'' we undertook research using a survey.
In Section \ref{section:survey_method}, we describe the method of this survey.
Section \ref{section:survey_results} examines the outcomes of our research.
Finally, in Section \ref{section:survey_discussion}, we discuss the threats to the validity of our approach.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we presented a description of the details of the survey we conducted.
Thirty, mostly experienced or expert Drools users, responded. 

The goal of this survey was to find if users of Drools would find the projections we created useful.
The outcome seems to be that they seem helpful, but not better than the text they are currently used to.

We tried to control for different groupings that may affect the responses, and in most cases, we found no significant differences in the groups we presented.
There was a significant difference between the projections presented, with the sample, in general, preferring the spreadsheet projection over the decision table.
