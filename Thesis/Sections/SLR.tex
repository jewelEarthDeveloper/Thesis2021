\chapter{Systematic Literature Review}
\label{chapter:SLR}

In this chapter, to answer the questions ``What is the current state of language workbenches supporting projectional editing?'', we embarked on a systematic literature review (SLR).
In section \ref{section:slr_method} we describe the method of this SLR.
Section \ref{section:slr_result} examines the outcome of our research.
Finally, in section \ref{section:slr_discussion} we discuss the threats to validity of our approach.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we presented a description of the details of the SLR we conducted.
The quality assessment filter was not adequate to the task of this review, thus the review could not be considered to completely follow the methodology design.
Looking only at papers created in the 18 months prior to conducting the review, 29 papers met our criteria.

A large majority of these researches were design science research studies.
The tool that was used for most of the papers was JetBrains MPS.
Papers using MPS were focused on industrial and educational use, whereas those not using MPS were mostly experimenting with the projectional form.

We ran sentiment analysis on these papers. 
Results were inconclusive.

Two areas of improvement, would be to design a better quality assessment filter and to improve the data cleaning for the sentiment analysis.
