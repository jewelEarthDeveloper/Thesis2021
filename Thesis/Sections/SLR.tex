\chapter{Systematic Literature Review}
\label{chapter:SLR}

In this chapter, to answer the question ``What is the current state of language workbenches supporting projectional editing?'' we embarked on a systematic literature review (SLR).
In section \ref{section:slr_method}, we describe the method of this SLR.
Section \ref{section:slr_result} examines the outcome of our research.
Finally, in section \ref{section:slr_discussion}, we discuss the threats to the validity of our approach.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we presented a description of the details of the SLR we conducted.
The quality assessment filter was not adequate for the task of this review. 
Thus, the review did not follow the methodology design completely.
Looking only at papers created in the 18 months prior to conducting the review, 29 papers met our criteria.

A large majority of these papers were design science research studies.
JetBrains MPS was the tool used for most of the papers.
Papers using MPS focused on industrial and educational use, whereas those not using MPS mainly experimented with the projectional form.

We ran sentiment analysis on these papers. 
Results were inconclusive.

Two areas of improvement would be to design a better quality assessment filter and to improve the data cleaning for the sentiment analysis.
