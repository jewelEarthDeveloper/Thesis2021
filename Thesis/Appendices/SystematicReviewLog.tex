\chapter{Systematic Literature Review Log} \label{Appendix:SLRLog}

\section{Search Description} 
The papers we found with our automatic search can be found in table \ref{table:Systematic_Review_Log}.
There were 100 unique papers found with the search strings across all of the venues when we used the search string and date restrictions.  
First we excluded those that were not in English or were unavailable to us.
This reduced the count to 94.
Next we downloaded each of the papers. 

Next we skimmed all of these papers to remove any that were obviously unrelated to projectional editing.
This reduced the count to 69.

two of the papers were referring to the same study, which reduced the count to 67.

We then excluded all grey literature, i.e. masters projects, proposals and phd thesies, and also books.
This brought us down to 51 papers.

At this point we began our quality assesment.
xxx papers fell below our quality threshold, which left us with xxx papers to assess to determine the current state of projectional editing.
[TODO: fill in the quality numbers]

\section{Table description}
Table \ref{table:Systematic_Review_Log} shows the log of the Systematic literature review.

The First column ``Paper Title'' is the name of the paper as given by the search engine.

The second column ``Lib'', indicates the library or search engine through which it was found.  
The Libraries are Identified by the Keys in table \ref{table:SearchEngineKey}.

precision = search selected over total selected
sensitivity (recall) = total searched over search selected

The third and fourth columns show inclusion and exclusion reasons.
As inclusions only rely on one question, ``does this paper discuss projectional editing'', the affirmative is indicated by a tick.
The exclusion column includes the reason for  the exclusion.

The fifth column, QA, gives the the Quality Assesment Criteria score.
This score is calculated As described in the Methods section.

Ths final column ``ref'', gives a link to the citations in the separate bibliography for the systematic literature review, found at the end of the Appendicies.
