\chapter{Systematic Literature Review Log} 
\label{Appendix:SLRLog}

\section*{Search Description} 
We show the papers we found with our automatic search in Table \ref{table:Systematic_Review_Log_1}.
From the 173 total papers found with the search strings across all venues when we used the search string and date restrictions, there were 100 unique papers.
First, we excluded those not in English (5) or unavailable to us (3), reducing the count to 92.
Next, we downloaded each of the papers.

Next, we skimmed all of these papers to remove any unrelated to projectional editing (24), reducing the count to 68.

Two of the papers were referring to the same study, which reduced the count to 66.

We then excluded all grey literature (14), i.e., masters projects, proposals and PhD theses, and books (2), reducing the count to 50 papers.

\section*{Table description}
Table \ref{table:Systematic_Review_Log_1} shows the log of the Systematic literature review.

The First column, ``Paper Title'', is for the paper's name returned by the search engine.

The second column, ``Venue'', indicates which library or search engine found the paper.
Table \ref{table:SearchEngineKey} maps the keys to the venues.

The third and fourth columns show inclusion and exclusion reasons.
As inclusions only rely on one question, ``does this paper discuss projectional editing'', the affirmative is indicated by a tick.
The exclusion column includes the reason for the exclusion.

The columns F\# and B\# represent the count of papers harvested from these papers for the first forward and backwards snowballing iteration.
