\label{appendix:QualityAssesmentChecklist} 
The Center for Evidence-Based Management (CEBMa) supports the application of evidence-based practices to the field of management and leadership.
They have a collection of checklists for assessing different types of studies.
These checklists have been adapted from the pocket guide to critical appraisal\cite{crombie1997pocket}.
We gave used these as the basis of our quality assessment checklists.
