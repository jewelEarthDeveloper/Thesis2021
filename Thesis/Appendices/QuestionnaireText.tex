\section{Page 1 - Introduction}

This survey should take [X] minutes to complete.  
It is part of a Masters Project by Paul Spencer at the University of Amsterdam.

The purpose is to determine whether projectional editing can be used to aid the comprehensibility of Business rules from the point of view of a software developer. 
We are using Drools as our example business rules language.

You were selected as you asked or answered a Drools question on StackOverflow, listed Drools as a skill on your linkedin profile or were referred this survey by someone who did.
It is therefore assumed you are aware of what Drools is.

Projectional editing is a form of writing computer programs directly rather than in text and having that parsed to create the program.
It allows you to directly edit the program from different projections or views upon the code.
In this survey we will present you a few of these views.
