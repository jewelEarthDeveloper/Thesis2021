the session holds your data like an in memory database

reactive systems - when I have changes I react to them
declarative systems

rule engine is like a trigger on a views

which rule should you fire first?
it should not matter, but salience. (drools 6 also has implied order in file)

init rule has no lhs/when, which means it is always true

rule chaining - data drives the rules

i need to work out what logical insert is

look for coupling, monlithic, leaky - information exposed, 

policy rule : e.g. isChild, isAdult

de-couple knowledge responsibilities
encapsulate knowledge
provide semantic abstraction for encapsulation
integrity robustness - truth maintenance
