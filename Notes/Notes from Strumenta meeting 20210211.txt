 The Limit of my language is the limit of my world
 
 mps meetup 2018 - reflections on teaching MPS within a university course
 
 how to motivate it
 - no parsing needed
 non-textual notations
 allows languages to evolve
 languages can be combined with each other
 no ambiguities in the ast
 
 start by explaining abstract syntax ( structure + behaviour + constraints)
 then (several) concrete syntax ( editor + formatting + actions)
 then type system
 then intentions
 then code generation (model to text then model to model)
 
 a dsl for each of the above aspects
 
 language != its syntax (MPS allows multiple syntaxes)
 sourcecode != text (notations, textual, tabular, mathematical, graphical)
 program == model at the right level of abstraction
