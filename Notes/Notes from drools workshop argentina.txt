what are rule engines used - where are they not used?
market share 
expert systems - 2 bibles: 1 by peter jackson and one by gary riley
drools books - (publisher)packet - drools Jboss rules 5.0 Developers guide

rule engine - is a broad term, expert system, automate complex decision
 - came out of the medical industry to help diagnostics
 - drendal, mysing(misin?) centaur, gravida, wheeze , clot
  - research died out in the 80's when ran out of money, no scalability, hardware support wasn't good enough
  - in 1979 chales forgey came out with the rete algorythm, 
	- haley, art, clips (free from nasa)
  - there has been no comercial move forward in the rule engines themselves since 1993
  - taking advantage of this Drools has become the market leader
  - drools 4 added declaritiveness and functional paradigm
  - drools 5 integrated platform - complex event processing, workflow, new rete algorithm
  - x droolsflow/jpm5 workflow
  - x droolcomplex - complex editor
  - semantics and ontologies

Terminolgy
 - expert systems
 - reasoning systems
	- production rules system (forward chaining - reactive) when something happens do this - reactive like a trigger on a database
	- logic programming (backwards chaining) like prolog queries - is mary a decendent of jane
	- functional - operating on lists (maping or folding)
 - description logic = ontologies, taxonomies, vocabularies, like a class model with a relationship
 
 - what are guided editors?
 - can I make views for decision tables, decision trees, (scorecards?), templates?
 - a rule is a superset of sql
 - object type, binding (:),
 - constraints + object type = pattern
 - when = lhs
 - then = rhs = action = consequence
 - a rule (when?) is like a (sql) view on your data 
 - a then is like a trigger on that view
 
 object type + patterns is propositional logic
 first order logic = sets
 
 - plugin own aggregation - how to in mps
