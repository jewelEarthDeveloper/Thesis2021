 submit rukes to a rule execution server
 
 DataSet configuration- can we use this?
 
 rule Execution server - provision and tooled
 
 Decision model notation specification
 what are decision requirement diagrams (DRDs?)
 
 Decision tables
 
 phreak algorythm is an evolution of rete algorythm
 ReteOO Drools 3,4&5
 * node sharing
 * alpha indexing
 * beta indexing
 * tree based graphs
 * modify-in-place
 * property reactive
 * sub-networks
 * backward chaining
 * lazy truth Maintenance
 * Heap based agenda tool
 * Dynamic rules
 
 Phreak
 * lazy Evaluation
 * Isolated rule evaluation
 * Increamental Goal ORientated Evaluations
 * Set Orientated Propogations
 * Stack based evaluations with pause and resume
 
 theres no evaluation when inserting the data
 what scheduling means is that it goes onto hte adgenda the adgenda has a list of all the links and rule and it puts them in order of priority, the priority is based on position in file (salience is obayed but advise to not use it)
 rete algorithms means that you don't want to reevaluate matches that you've made
 
 internal core state machine - it was ambigious with thread safety issues
 only one point that is synced (propogation queue) the engine is now isolated from ations
 it's not deterministic but it's understandable
 lots of thread saftey issues around timers
 
 for rule engines to have a future drl has to die!
