Drools\cite{browne2009jboss} is an open-source production rule system for complex event processing, using an implementation of the Rete algorithm\cite{forgy1989rete}.
It has its own Domain Specific Language (DSL), in which rules are described.
These are stored in Drools (.drl) files. 
Reasoning about a small number of rules is hard, at the host organization there are many files with dozens of rules in them.
This Masters project will attempt to improve how one can reason about Drools rules.

Editing in language workbenches comes in two forms, either free-form text editing or, less frequently, projectional editing\cite{erdweg2013state}.
Projectional editing is a method of bypassing the parser and programming directly into projections of the Abstract Syntax Tree.
We will recreate the Drools DSL using a language workbench capable of creating projectional editors.  
On top of this newly modelled DSL, we will create new and different projections of the code for the purpose of increasing the reasonability of the code. 

In this project we will use the open-source language workbench Meta Programming System (MPS) from JetBrains\cite{MPS_ProductPage}.
MPS is built around the projectional editing paradigm.
There is no existing implementation of the Drools language in MPS.
Although Drools is nearly 20 years old and has wide use, it does not have strong IDE support.
One artefact of this master's project will be a prototype projectional editor, that will give much stronger editor support in IntelliJ, currently the most used IDE\cite{Java_usage_report}.
