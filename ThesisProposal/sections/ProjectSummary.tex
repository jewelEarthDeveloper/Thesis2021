\section{Project summary}
{\LARGE DONE}

Drools is an open source production rule system for complex event processing, using an implementation of the Rete algorithm.
It has it's own Domain Specific Language, which are written in Drools files.
When there are many rule in an environment it can be difficult to reason about the rules and how they interact.


Although Drools is nearly 20 years old and has wide use, it does not have strong cross platform IDE support.
This masters project will approach fixing this by creating a projectional editing IDE.
There are two popular editing methods for language workbenches, these are free-form editing, where the user typically edits the source code, and projectional editing,
where the user edits one or more projections of the persisted model\cite{erdweg2013state}.
Projectional editing could be seen as a method of bypassing the parser and programming directly into the Abstract Syntax Tree.
In this project we will use the opensource language workbench MPS from JetBrains\cite{MPS_ProductPage}.
There is no existing implementation of the Drools language in MPS.


%describe the relevancy of this 
Khonraad Software Engineering's product, Khonraad, is a SaaS used by the Dutch local governments, implementing the Wvggz, Wzd and Wth laws. 
These laws deal with very sensitive details about mental health and domestic violence.
It goes without saying that this data must not be accessed by the wrong people.
Drools is the Technology choice Khonraad made to govern this critical function.
Thus, they would like to improve the reasonability of this code.



This project will attempt to answer the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1:} How can we apply projectional editing to Drools to increase reasoning?  
    \item \textbf{RQ2:} Which refactorings will most benefit a Drools code clarity?
\end{itemize}
