Good code is code that can be reasoned about.
Drools is a rules based business engine, with rules represented in a DSL.
When the number of rules grow it becomes difficult to reason about them.

Projectional editors are editors where developers program directly into projections of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Projectional editors can have multiple projections over the same AST.

It is the intent of this project to investigate whether the use of various projections can address the feedback requirements to allow developers to reason better about their business rules.
