Drools is a rules-based business engine, with rules represented in a DSL.
When there are a large number of rules in a system, it becomes difficult to reason about them.

Projectional editors are editors where developers program directly into projections of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Projectional editors can have multiple editable projections or representations of the same AST.

It is the intent of this project to investigate whether the use of various projections of a Drools AST can address the feedback requirements to allow developers to reason better about their business rules.
