\section{Timeline}

This prototype project consists of two main parts.
First is modelling the Drools structure, behaviour, constraints, editors, and generators.
The second will be creating non-standard projections of the structure.

The gathering of data to inform the design decisions for the projections will run in parallel to implementing the Drools DSL.

Time will be allocated as 20 hours of my work time per week will be dedicated to design and development of the software.
Currently estimating 4-8 hours at the weekends to research and project writing.
There is an added period of 4 weeks at the end to rewriting the thesis.
This is shown in the Gantt Chart in figure \ref{fig:ganttchart}.
