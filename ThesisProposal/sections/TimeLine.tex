\section{Timeline}
{\LARGE DONE}

This project consists of two main parts.
First is modelling the Drools structure, behaviour, constraints, editors and generators.
The second will be creating non-standard projections of the structure.

Time will be allocated as 20 hours of my work time per week will be dedicated to design and development of the software.
Currently estimating 4-8 hours at the weekends to research and project writing.
There is an added period of 4 weeks at the end to rewriting the thesis.
This is shown in the Gantt Chart in figure \ref{fig:ganttchart}
