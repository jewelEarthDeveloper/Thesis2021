\subsection{Research Questions}

The research question we wish to answer is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Main Research Question:} ``How can projectional editors and DSLs be combined to address feedback mechanisms for developers in the context of reasoning about rules in a rule-based business engine?''
\end{itemize}

This question requires knowing if it is possible with current tooling, thus we would like to answer the question:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Research Sub-Question 1:} ``What is the current state of language workbenches supporting projectional editing?''
\end{itemize}

Finally, we specifically would like to know how we can improve the ability to reason about the business rules engine, so we ask the question:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Research Sub-Question 2:} ``Which projections can help developers to get appropriate feedback about rules?''
\end{itemize}
