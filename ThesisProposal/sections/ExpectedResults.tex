\section{Expected results} 

We expect the following from this project:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=2pt,itemsep=2pt,partopsep=2pt, parsep=2pt]
    \item We will be able to model Drools in MPS.
    \item We will create a suite of novel and useful projectional editors for the Drools language.
    \item We will reduce the thought to execution cycle for Drools developers, resulting in a reduction of their ``cognitive distance and representation impedance mismatch''\cite{live_literals}.
\end{itemize}

A happy side effect of this project is that the following open-source products will become available to the public domain:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=2pt,itemsep=2pt,partopsep=2pt, parsep=2pt]
    \item An improved Drools editor plugin for the JetBrains IntelliJ community edition.
	\item An MPS implementation of the Drools DSL that can be used by other MPS language implementations for model to model generation.
\end{itemize}
