\section{Expected results of the project.} 

We expect the following from this project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We will be able to model Drools in MPS.
    \item A suite of novel and useful projectional editors for the Drools language.
    \item We will reduce the thought to execution cycle for Drools Developers. resulting in a reduction of the “cognitive distance and representation
    impedance mismatch”\cite{live_literals} that they currently experience.
\end{itemize}

A happy side effects of this project is that the following open-source products will become generally available:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An improved Drools Editor plugin for those using the JetBrains IntelliJ community edition.
	\item An MPS implementation of Drools that can be used for cross-generation by other MPS Language implementations.
\end{itemize}
