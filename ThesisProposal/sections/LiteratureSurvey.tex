\section{Literature survey}
Describe the following regarding the scientific literature related to your topic:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 	Brief summary of contents: how did you organize the gathering of related literature? which method/sources did you use?
	\item	Relation to your topic: how does the work described in the reference differ from your approach, what results have they obtained, what open questions are still left?
\end{itemize}
Aim for a "matrix" structure of the literature survey: What are the features desired from the outcome of your research? How are these features delivered by existing work? Are there gaps unanswered by existing work? 

A guideline is to include between 10 and 20 papers on your topic in the survey. The exact number depends on the topic and available literature.
