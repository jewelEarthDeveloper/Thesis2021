\section{Risks} 

There are various risks we will face, such as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Our designs of the projections, which will run in parallel to the Drools language modelling, will depend in part on the outcome of research carried out in the first period.
	\item Whether our design is appropriate with regards to performance and functionality.
	\item Whether we can achieve usefulness in our projections.
\end{itemize}

We hope to mitigate these risks through literature review and academic supervision.

What we consider to be our greatest risks are shown in table \ref{table:risk}.
