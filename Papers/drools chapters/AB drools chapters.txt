 A business rule is any bit of knowledge that can be expressed in the following format:
When 'something' is true, Then do 'this'.

Is it Drools or JBoss
Rules? Officially it is now the latter, although it started out as 'Drools' and
the name is still in common usage. This book tends to use 'Drools' as it is
shorter to type and read. Both terms refer to the same thingâ€”the business
rules product from Red Hat and JBoss.

The description of the information we need and the
format it is stored in is known as the fact model.

Remember that a rule engine will not run in isolation, but be embedded in a wider
system. What the 'rest of the system' will be will depend on your project, but the
rules will pass data back and forward to it by means of the fact classes
