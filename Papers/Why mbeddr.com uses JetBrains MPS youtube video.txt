mps uses a projectional editor which avoids parsing and some of the problems that parsing implies.
projectional editing means that every edit directly changes the syntax tree and no grammars or parsers are involved.

advantages: if you dont parse, you can use languages and notations that are not parsable.
obviously you can use regular code or text, but you can also use mathmatical symbols tables and also graphical diagrams.

projectional editing also supports language composition.  because you never run into ambiguities language composition is much more flexible compared to parser based systems.

Historically Projectional editors have had useability challenges and weren't used much in practice.  MPS has
addressed most of these useablity challenges successfully (show mps usability study)
