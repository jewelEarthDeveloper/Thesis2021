 Language developers can define data-flow graph builders declaratively as
part of a language definition and compute analysis results
efficiently based on these data-flow graphs

MPS is a projectional language workbench where programs
are represented as abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Each AST
node is an instance of a language concept (meta class)

should I use data-flow analysis to simulate drools? (NO!)

DCFlow [9] is a DSL and Rascal library for constructing control flow graphs of programs. The DSL is similar
to the flow-sensitive part of our builder DSL

n. In contrast,
MPS-DF only requires a new builder implementation and no
modifications to the analyses
