AB - Preliminary Experience of using mbeddr for Developing Embedded Software

mbeddr builds on the JetBrains MPS language
workbench2
, a tool that supports the definition, composition and integrated use of general
purpose or domain-specific languages. MPS uses a projectional editor, which means that,
although a syntax may look textual, it is not represented as a sequence of characters which
are transformed into an abstract syntax tree (AST) by a parser. Instead, a user’s editing actions lead directly to changes in the AST. Projection rules render a concrete syntax from the
AST. Consequently, MPS supports non-textual notations such as tables or mathematical
symbols, and it also supports wide-ranging language composition and extension [Voe11]
– no parser ambiguities can ever occur when combining languages.

As part of mbeddr’s tutorials, an example extension has been built that annotates data
structures with information about which layer of the system is allowed to write and read
these values. By annotation program modules with layer information, the IDE can now
check basic architectural constraints, such as whether a data element is allowed to be
written from a given program location
