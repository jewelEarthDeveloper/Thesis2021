AB - Gaining Industrial Confidence for the Introduction of Domain-Specific Languages 
In general, the introduction of DSLs in product development is not for free.
For instance, [14] observes that “DSL development is hard, requiring both domain knowledge and language development expertise.
Few people have both.
Not surprisingly, the decision to develop a DSL is often postponed indefinitely.”


When starting to develop a DSL in practice, one of the first questions is what tools to use.
This concerns tools for the users and the developers of the DSL, as is also indicated by the guideline “Tooling Matters!” from [23].

There are two typical kinds of languages, namely, textual and graphical.
The guideline “Adopt existing notations domain experts use” from [10] advocates to reuse notation from the domain itself.
The guidelines “Decide carefully whether to use graphical or textual realization” from [10] and “Graphical vs.
Textual Notation” from [23] compare these main types of languages.
An important observation is that textual languages and their editors are faster to develop
