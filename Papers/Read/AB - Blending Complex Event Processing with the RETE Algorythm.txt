 a production rule system
 
 
 . The event pattern must be detected from one or
more streams of events and the condition pattern must be matched from among
business objects (facts) pertaining to the application state.

Data-driven and eventdriven execution.

 Considering an
application as a state machine, events represent transitions, cf. [7]. When an
event is detected, the appropriate transition is taken. The event may then be
discarded. Facts, on the other hand, represent state. A rule condition determines
a state to be held before a transition may be taken. Facts remain valid and must
be retained until they are explicitly removed in a state change

The analogy of
a state machine provides a usable guide to distinguish between events and facts.

Facts, on the other hand, are persistent and must explicitly be deleted. 
 facts may be changed.
 facts fetched via pull
Facts have a potentially indefinite lifetime. They are only removed
if they are explicitly retracted. 
ection 1) the modify-operation of the working memory is not applicable. 

In fact, Walzer marks events as immutable facts (cf. [15]) in her implementation
for the rule engine Drools


I should add a distinction in my nodes as to whether or not they are relying on events or pseudo/events such as temporal factors .
