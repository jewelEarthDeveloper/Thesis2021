AB - Shadow Models: Incremental Transformations for MPS


Feature modeling is well-established for modeling variability in product lines [9]: a feature model specifies the set of possible products by defining identifiable features and the constraints between them; configurations specify individual products by selecting features while respecting the constraints. 

MPS models are trees with cross-references (or: graphs with a single containment hierarchy).
Those cross-references are particularly challenging: a reference of some type P between input nodes A and B must be mapped to a reference of some type Q between the corresponding output nodes A’ and B’.

.
Dclare for MPS is another incremental transformation engine that relies on contraints instead of functional transformations.
