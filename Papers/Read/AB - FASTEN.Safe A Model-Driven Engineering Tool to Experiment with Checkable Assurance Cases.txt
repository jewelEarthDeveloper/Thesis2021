AB FASTEN.Safe A Model-Driven Engineering Tool to Experiment with Checkable Assurance Cases 
uses mps to create a textual/graphical GSN language for assurance 

These extensions sufficy to express three patterns from the literature [7], [10].
The language workbench MPS allows easy implementation of extensions in a modular fashion. 

Another distinguishing characteristic of FASTEN.Safe, that allows us to implement the checks, is that it features language extensions of GSN that raise the abstraction level at which assurance cases are modeled.
