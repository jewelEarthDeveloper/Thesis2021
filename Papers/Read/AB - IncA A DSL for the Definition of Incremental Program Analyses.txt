AB - IncA: A DSL for the Definition of Incremental Program Analyses

We have implemented IncA on top of JetBrains MPS,1
an
IDE that relies on projectional editing, where code changes
occur in the form of user-issued AST change requests. This
aligns well with incrementalization because each AST change
triggers an incremental update of the analysis results.

Much like our informal description of the relations above,
a graph pattern describes sets of related entities through
structural constraints on AST nodes and on instances of
other graph patterns.

In our implementation based on projectional editing, we
receive change events for user-issued AST changes directly
from the IDE.  Fine-grained AST change notifications align
perfectly with incrementalization and there is no need for a
potentially costly parsing step to compute AST differences.
After an AST change, a projectional editor derives a new
projection from the AST and displays it to the programmer

We instantiated the architecture for the Meta Programming
System (MPS) using IncQuery [35] as the incremental evaluator. Both tools are available as open-source software, as is
our implementation.2
MPS is an IDE that uses projectional editing [38] instead
of a parser-based approach. When editing the program in a
projectional editor, every user edit (for example, inserting
an operator) directly corresponds to an AST change. After
an AST change, a projectional editor renders new projection
from the changed AST based on projection rules of the AST
nodes and displays it to the programmer. Projectional editing
is well-suited for incremental program analysis because the
userâ€™s edits directly correspond to incremental AST changes
and no incremental parsing is necessary.
Our system reuses the incremental graph pattern matching component of IncQuery. This component realizes the
computation graph presented in Section 2. The component
expects the graph patterns to be specified using the Java API
PSystem.3 We implemented the IncA compiler to translate
graph patterns into a PSystem specification. After startup,
IncQuery uses the navigator to initialize its computation
graph and to retrieve AST changes.
